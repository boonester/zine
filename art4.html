            <div id="deatharticle">Fascism. Nobody is happy with the state of the country, left or right. Everyone seems
                disillusioned with the ideas of American exceptionalism and individualism and so they retreat into a
                fantasy of the West, where individuals still prevail, where this country seemed like it still had
                purpose. It is an escape to picture oneself in a world where you can just pack up and move to the
                frontier to start again amidst a reality where most are static, locked into the same few career paths
                and culture. Where this escape becomes problematic is when it becomes a tool of propaganda. Under the
                third reich, Germans were promised a future that honors the past of a unified, traditional people and an
                ancient aryan civilization, despite the real history of germany being barbarism, mud huts, and warring
                states. Propaganda under Mussolini often painted a romanticized and idealized image of ancient Rome to
                bring more into the fold of fascism. And now, ICE agents wear cowboy hats and the Department of Homeland
                Security posts paintings of pioneers in wagons with the caption "Remember your Homeland's Heritage".
