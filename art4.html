            <div id="deatharticle">Fascism. Nobody is happy with the state of the country, left or right. Everyone seems
                disillusioned with the ideas of American exceptionalism and individualism so they retreat into a
                fantasy of the West, where individuals still prevail, where this country seemed like it still had
                purpose. It is an escape to picture oneself in a world where you can just pack up and move to the
                frontier to start again amidst a reality where most are static, locked into the same few career paths
                and cultures. Where this escape becomes problematic is when it becomes a tool of propaganda. Under the
                third reich, Germans were promised a future that honors their past of a unified, traditional German
                people and the existence ancient aryan civilization. All this despite the real history of Germany being barbarism, mud huts, and
                warring states. Propaganda under Mussolini often painted a romanticized and idealized image of ancient Rome to
                bring more into the fold of fascism. The vast majority of western media upholds these contradictions, spouting revisionist
                history that paints natives as a step away from beasts with a whitewashed cast. These bits of western
                media enforce the idea that settlers where right to take what was free, their deaths at
                the hands of natives was because of anti white of racism and not counter terrorism, and that the less white neighbors to the south
                were uneducated scoundrels that would do anything to swindle you out of your cash or saddle. And now,
                ICE agents wear cowboy hats and the Department of Homeland Security posts paintings of pioneers in wagons with the caption "Remember your Homeland's Heritage".
