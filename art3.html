            <div id="lifearticle">These days it seems you cant dodge a rhinestone cowboy. Online and in the real world
                there is a striking rise in people who draw upon western aesthetics, whether they grew up taking the
                subway or shoveling shit in a horse pasture. Country music is bigger than ever, increasingly so with
                urban and suburban people. This recent increase in country music's popularity is so pervasive that
                having established country artists reach chart and reach greater success is not enough. Now, pop stars new and old like Beyonce
                and Chappell Roan have to throw their stetson hat in the mix. This western revival has its pros, as a
                world once deemed too boorish for most is beginning to be widely appreciated again. Amidst a semi-recent
                rise in the desire to throw your phone in the river and move to a cabin in the woods, it seems fitting that
                regular people bound to the modern world would want to live a rustic life. It seems fitting that someone
                in an office job with a social media presence would want to reclaim some idea of self reliance by
                putting on the cowboy act. Simple actions such as getting an energy drink at the gas station are now compared to a cowboy and his horse drinking from the same well amidst a long trudge through the desert. But this reality of being shackled to the internet has existed for years, so
                why now?</div>
