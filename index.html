    <p>Im a cynical bastard but also have a lot of love for a lot of things so i want a zine where i can rant and gush
        over things. I remember when I was presenting my feed website you scoffed when i said I hate the internet but
        the truth is I don't but I also do. For better or for worse the internet made me who I am so I want to bring
        that split nature of my affection into a zine about culture. The concept would be called "life and death" or
        something equally dumb and half of the zine would be life where I talk about things that don't suck and the
        other half death where I talk about things that do. It would be pretty multimedia based so each article/2014
        tumblr level rant essay would be accompanied by an original digital collage a la the album cover of
        schlagenheim. I wanna have it very music based as well so I'd want to have some amount of background music to
        give it that late 90s personal website or YTMD post experience but I can not figure out how to get the audio tag
        to work consistently. I just got a sampler so it would be cool to make my own background music but when I
        undoubtably leave the bulk of this project to the two minutes before the due date I may have to cut that
        feature. </p>
