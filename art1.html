            <div id="lifearticle">I love cds. I love collecting them, I love playing them, I love seeing them around my
                apartment. Cds are cool, and you should buy them. Compared to vinyl they are quite cheap, often
                practically free as nobody wants them. I did not buy my stereo and cd changer, I found it abandoned by
                the side of the road in the rain. The fact I found a bjork cd at a goodwill should tell you that
                everyone, no matter what they listen to, is getting rid of their cds as they age and they are yours for
                the taking. Compared to both vinyl and cassettes, cds are reliable and no fuss. Most likely, whatever cd
                player you come across will not need extensive set up, or magnetic head cleaners. It's for this reason
                cds are the perfect physical media for those raised by streaming services. Most people of this
                generation drive older cars, so most have some option to play cds. Once a cd gets someone through the
                door of physical media, they provide great perspective in how music is made and the people that make it.
                My favorite example of this are liners, something completely neglected in streaming. Its in the liners
                where someone can learn the names of the musicians, the producers, the studios, and the lyrics. Often
                they have photos that give more insight into the process or push the art direction of the entire album.
                An example is the album Rated R by Queens of the Stone age, an album based around lyrical themes that
                would be Rated R. To bolster this theme, Each lyrics page comes with a mock MPA rating and fake movie posters.
                All of this you can not glean from spotify's karaoke style lyrics section. On top of this, they often
                have better audio quality if you're a nerd like that. All the other arguments about physical media can
                be made like longevity as well. My Bloody Valentine recently removed half their catalogue off streaming
                services, which was not a problem for me as I had physical copies. If Kevin Shields really wants to stop
                me he'll have to break down my door and take my copies from my cold, dead hands. You should buy cds as
                even if you do not play them, they make great desk or mantelplace decor. </div>
