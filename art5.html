                The internet should have brought on the most culturally diverse time period in history. How did we get
                here? It seems the era in which the internet rewarded content creators for using their own personality
                to create content that people found unique and interesting. In an era where cable and the antiquated
                content they played still had a death grip
                on entertainment, internet content filled the niche for media that better represented and catered to the
                personalities and interests of people not represented in Hollywood. People wanted to best each other,
                building upon others ideas and generally lambasting those who take the easy way out and steal or rehash
                tired concepts. In middle school I remember the rabid hatred towards youtube channels like 5 minute
                crafts and mr. gear, solely because they recycled the same boring and unapplicable "life hacks" while
                also constantly stealing content from each other. Sssniperwolf and jinx were lambasted for shamelessly
                ripping other peoples contents and giving them half ass reactions and passing it off as content. This
                was the birth of slop as we know it and it was hated. But now it is the meta. Since the proliferation
                and force-feeding of short form content on every major platform began, more and more trend hopping has
                been rewarded
