                The internet should have brought on the most culturally diverse time period in history. How did we get
                here? It seems the era in which the internet rewarded content creators for using their own personality
                to create content that people found unique and interesting has ended. In an era where cable and the
                antiquated
                content they played still had a death grip
                on entertainment, internet content filled the niche for media that better represented and catered to the
                personalities and interests of people not represented in Hollywood. People wanted to best each other,
                building upon others ideas and generally lambasting those who take the easy way out and steal or rehash
                tired concepts. In middle school I remember the rabid hatred towards youtube channels like 5 minute
                crafts and mr. gear, solely because they recycled the same boring and unapplicable "life hacks" while
                also constantly stealing content from each other. Sssniperwolf and jinx were lambasted for shamelessly
                ripping other peoples contents and giving them half ass reactions and passing it off as content. This
                was the birth of slop as we know it and it was hated. But now it is the meta. Since the proliferation
                and force-feeding of short form content on every major platform began, more and more trend hopping has
                been rewarded and more and more content creators are more shameless in how little they change when
                copying someone else's homework. A several hundred year old lebanese recipe for kafta meat in pita can
                blow up overnight, with every food creator magically having the idea to make it and hold the stacked
                pitas in front of the camera in the same exact manner as everyone else. One person posts a video of an
                ethnic food recipe with music from a different country and now everyone is holding up their arayes to
                the camera. Restaurants will create dishes solely for the purpose of being picked up by the wave of
                influencers who will say nothing beyond "its so good" with the same vocal inflections. This death loop
                of people stealing each other's content has created what I call "cultural incest", in which content is
                only birthed from its own, with the bloodline gradually degrading until the trend dies a premature
                death. This concept has turbocharged existing commercialist trend cycles in which something is popular
                enough to create a bubble in which everyone buys a product for it to collect dust five months later.
                These days, five months has become two at best. People are now constantly subjected to fomo about a new
                and useless item or meal or movie at rates we have not seen before. Obviously, the concept of viral
                content is nothing new, but even then the content that expemplified it would build upon the concept. The
                harlem shake, as pointless as it was, created an environment where people around the world were
                constantly trying to one-up each other, making their take on the video wilder and zanier than the last.
                In this era, one needs simply to rip the base content off word for word and shot for shot to find
                success. Until the short form content regime collapses, this is not something I see going away any time soon.
