        <div id="lifearticle">45 Pounds is the debut album by New York/Philadelphia experimental music group YHWH
            Nailgun. Released in March of 2025, this album immediately snatched the album of the year spot for me as it
            is truly unlike anything I have ever heard, all while not straying too far from its influences. The dizzying
            drum beats and massive soundscapes created through the synthesized guitars had me on my toes, constantly
            failing to guess what the next part of the song or album would bring. The vocals are erratic and demented in
            the best way possible with the occasional rabid dog yelp cutting through the song like a laser. Its a
            relatively short listen that is easy to play on repeat. There are occasional moments in which I feel musical
            choices were made solely for the purpose of sounding experimental, namely the barrage of kick drums in the
            track Pain Fountain, however the rest of the song and album earns the right to be edgy. This band and album
            are truly a gem of the post covid world and this is a sound I hope to see continued and built upon in the
            future. </div>
